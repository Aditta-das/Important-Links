DSA problem solving ->

'''
If an input array is sorted then
  - Binary search
  - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
  - Backtracking

If given a tree then
  - DFS
  - BFS

If given a graph then
  - DFS
  - BFS

If given a linked list then
  - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
  - Stack

If must solve in-place then
  - Swap corresponding values
  - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
  - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
  - Heap

If asked for common strings then
  - Map
  - Trie

Else
  - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
  - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

Getting Ready for a Software Engineer problem-solving interview with top tech companies!

Here are the topics you need to be focused on most:
1- Concepts:
- Big O Time & Space
- Memory ( Stack vs. Heap )
- Bit Manipulation
- String Processing
- Recursion
- DP (Dynamic Programming)

2- Data Structures:
- Linked List
- Vectors & ArrayList
- Stack & Queue
- Hash Table (Hash Map)
- Tree & Graph
- Heap

3- Algorithms:
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms (at least Quick Sort & Merge Sort)

Go over them one by one, start from the concept and very basic examples and then harder problems and so on.

Then problem-solving interviews will be a piece of cake...
